        <p>
            During a White House meeting between President Donald Trump and Norwegian Prime minister
            Erna Solberg on January 10, 2018, Solberg gave Trump a Ping "Bergen" Putter as a gift as a symbol of the
            close ties between the nations, and the history of Norwegian immigration to the United States. Born in
            Norway, Ping's founder Karsten Solheim was from Austrheim, outside Bergen;[10] as a toddler,
            he moved with his family to Seattle, Washington.
